		 		Software code and Software architecture as a very abstract and very complex metaphor, oppose a good example 
		  		to examine the benefits of visualization over pure code and alphanumerically written codes and metaphors. 
		  		The visualization in the project is about method-calls in software projects. The main idea is to visualize a 
		  		certain method-call and see what other methods are triggered by this call. The visualization takes part in a 3D-space, 
		  		which enables the user to look at the method-call tree from different perspectives. The different perspectives provide 
		  		different views and different conclusions to the method-call."

		  "description" => "Core-concept: ZagHdaK Radio is an interactive GPS hear-play created at ZHdK in October 2009. 
		  The main concept is to have a real physical space (in our case ZÃ¼rich) in which a user can move around randomly.
		  This physical reality is then overlayed by a second perception layer (in our case audio feedback) which is supposed
		  to guide the user around in the physical reality and provide him with different audio information depending on the
		  chosen way. ZagHdaK-Radio plays with contrasts between imagination and reality and extends awareness and perception. 
		  Concept realisation: As second perception layer the ZagHdaK-Radio concept features an imaginary setup of an unnamed 
		  city in the Middle East. This imaginary layer is invisibly mapped over the physical reality and represented by audio 
		  feedback. Certain predefined points on the reality layer trigger certain soundactions on the audio layer. Interactivity
		  is provided by the way we move around and by the way approaching the predefined points. When strolling around far from
		  the predefined points the user is provided with monotonous audio-heartbeat; when approaching a point, the heartbeat speeds
		  up and finally, depending on distance to that point, triggers different sounds. Every point is accessible by different
		  streets and depending on the route chosen, one approaches the point in another context (correspondingly different sound is
		  played on the audio-layer). The predefined points and the corresponding soundfiles are arranged in a way that individual
		  narratives emerge when moving around. ZagHdaK radio is partly political since it talks about problematic tendencies in
		  world politics but does not consider itself as a purely political project; ZagHdaK radio features different approaches of
		  everyday life in a middle eastern town. "

		    car to sound. (Sensors were placed in the door (open and close), the seat (sit down) and the security belt (closing)). 
		    A research revealed, that the design of car shapes incline more and more organic features in future sketches. This project 
		    tries to apply this paradigm shift to the world of sounds. Three organic sound-skins were developped: liquid, bone and earthy."
